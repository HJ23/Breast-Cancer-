Breast cancer is most commonly seen cancer in USA.
In early stage symptoms might be neglected or are not noticed by women .
So early detection is key part for preventing.

Early detection is crucial phase if cancerous tissue,lump or cyst detected at that stage it will lead to early treatment eventually can save a lot lives.

Mammo is an web-based app tackles the issue.It has 3 early detection test and techniques :

1. Ai based Xray scanner
2. Microscopic cell imaging
3. Algorithmic decision maker

Ai based Xray scanner is tool uses custom deep learning network to indicate probabilistic cancer score of given xray image.Due to lack of training (about 2 hours) and training data (about 100 positive image) accuracy is not high.But still powerfull tool works well.
It is complicated task to identify cancer on given xray image even for experienced doctors.


Microscopic cell imaging is tool uses deep learning techniques to serve better prediction.

Algorithmic decision maker is algorithmic tool by asking few questions calculates cancer score.
This method is not most realible way identification of cancer but helpful for people from under-developed ,undeveloped or poor countries. Also can be used for monthly self assessment.


By email notifications app notifies user for monthly self-checkup , weekly tips about breast cancer and healthy lifestyle .


Eventually every doctor is responsible for what he prescribed,diagnosed and wrong diagnose might effect women mentally.This also effects doctors they want to be hundred percent sure everthing is just right and accurate.AI based this project can be used by doctors as well !
